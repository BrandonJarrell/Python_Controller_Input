# Python_Inputs  
I made my own program to map Xbox controller inputs to any keyboard inputs. I wanted to play non Xbox games with a controller and tweak the settings and make shortcuts how I wanted.

What really got me intersted once I achieved this, is the fact that once you can connect something to python, you can connect that thing to anything. 
I'm excited to now try controlling something externally with my controller through python using a raspberry pi.
